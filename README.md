Supply Chain Management System (Arivu Foods) – Agents Overview
Introduction
Arivu Foods, which offers a range of FMCG products (e.g. low-carb flours, snacks, oils, etc.), requires a supply chain management system to streamline its operations. This system will manage inventory, orders, customers, analytics dashboards, and billing for all products listed on Arivu’s website. It is designed for two primary user roles: the FMCG Admin (Arivu Foods’ management) and Local Retail Stores (partner retailers). To achieve efficiency and scalability, the system is organized into multiple agents (modular services), each handling a core function such as inventory or order processing. This modular design aligns with modern supply chain architectures, where each domain is handled by an independent component

. By automating key processes (while still allowing manual oversight), the system can manage inventory, sales, and customer information in one place, and automate processes like order processing, invoicing, and payment collection
oracle.com
. Such an integrated solution is expected to reduce errors and significantly boost operational efficiency (companies moving from manual tracking to integrated order systems have seen efficiency gains over 50%
trilinkftz.com
). The system will be implemented using Python and FastAPI, providing a robust RESTful API backend. (No third-party integrations are in scope for the initial version, focusing only on Arivu’s internal data.) In the sections below, we outline the user roles and the key agent modules of the system, along with how they interact in both automated and manual modes.
User Roles
FMCG Admin
The FMCG Admin represents Arivu Foods’ internal management. This user has full control over the supply chain system. Key capabilities of the FMCG Admin include:
Product & Inventory Management: Add new products from Arivu’s catalog, update product details, and monitor stock levels for each item. The admin can manually adjust inventory (e.g. after a stock count or receiving new stock) and set thresholds for reordering.
Order Supervision: Oversee orders placed by retail stores – view incoming orders, approve or reject them (if manual approval is enabled), and initiate fulfillment (packing and shipping). The admin can also configure the system to auto-approve orders that meet certain criteria (for efficiency).
Customer (Retailer) Management: Maintain a database of all partner retail stores. This includes store profiles, contact information, billing/delivery addresses, and any specific terms (such as credit limits or pricing tiers). This serves as a mini-CRM for B2B customers, ensuring all retailer data and history is in one place
medium.com
.
Analytics & Decision Making: Access a comprehensive dashboard with real-time analytics on sales, orders, and inventory status. The admin’s dashboard highlights metrics like total orders, revenue, top-selling products, stock alerts, and fulfillment rates. These reports help in demand forecasting and business decisions
trilinkftz.com
oracle.com
. For example, the admin can see if a particular flour mix is trending in sales or identify a retailer’s ordering patterns.
Billing & Finance: View and manage invoices for orders. The system automatically generates invoices for each retailer order, but the admin can review invoice records, send invoices to retailers, record payments, and handle any billing adjustments if needed.
Local Retail Store
Local retail store users are B2B customers (grocery stores, supermarkets, etc.) who source Arivu Foods products to sell in their shops. The system provides these users with tools to easily place orders and track their business with Arivu. Their capabilities include:
Product Catalog Browsing: View the entire Arivu Foods product catalog (all available SKUs from the website) with details like prices, unit sizes, and current stock availability. Retailers can search or filter products (e.g., by category like flours, snacks, oils) when preparing an order.
Order Placement & Tracking: Create new orders by adding desired products and quantities to a cart and submitting the order to Arivu. The system checks inventory in real-time to ensure items are in stock for the requested quantities
trilinkftz.com
. After placing an order, the retailer can track its status (e.g., pending approval, processed, shipped, delivered) through the dashboard. They receive notifications when an order is confirmed or shipped (e.g., via email or in-app alerts).
Invoice & Payment Viewing: Access the invoices for their orders automatically generated by the system. A retailer can download or print an invoice for their records. (While online payment integration is not in scope now, the retailer can mark an invoice as paid or see payment terms if, for example, they pay offline or on delivery.)
Analytics Dashboard: View a tailored dashboard of metrics relevant to the store’s orders. For instance, the retailer can see their order history, total spend over time, and top products they have purchased. Advanced reporting features allow them to analyze trends – e.g., which Arivu products sell fastest in their store – helping them plan reorders. Reports can include insights like top ordered products and order frequency
oracle.com
.
Account Management: Maintain their own store profile (update contact info, addresses, etc.) and view any special announcements or promotions from Arivu (if Arivu uses the platform to broadcast messages to retailers). The retailer’s account is linked to the customer management module so that Arivu’s admin always has up-to-date information.
Workflow Between Users: In a typical interaction, a local retailer will log in, browse products, and place an order for certain items. The FMCG Admin (or the automated order agent) will then process this order – verifying stock and confirming the order. The inventory levels update automatically once the order is confirmed. The system generates an invoice and makes it available to both the admin and the retailer. Finally, the admin arranges shipment, and the retailer receives the goods, closing the loop. This end-to-end process is managed within the system, ensuring both parties have transparency and up-to-date information at each step.
Inventory Management Agent
The Inventory Management Agent is responsible for maintaining accurate records of all product stock levels in the supply chain system. It acts as the central inventory controller for Arivu Foods’ products. This agent ensures that every addition or removal of stock is tracked in real time, which is critical for fulfilling orders and avoiding stockouts. According to modern SCM architecture, an Inventory Management service “tracks inventory levels, location, and availability, and handles inventory reservations.”
medium.com
 In our system, its key functions include:
Stock Tracking: Maintain a database of current stock for each product (e.g., each type of flour, snack, etc.). Every time stock is received (e.g., new batch production or procurement) or dispatched (sold via an order), the inventory counts are updated. The inventory agent ensures real-time visibility of product availability. This real-time syncing allows orders to be processed quickly without overselling
trilinkftz.com
.
Inventory Reservations: When a retailer places an order, this agent can reserve the required quantity for that order, marking it as allocated so it won’t be sold to someone else simultaneously. If the order is canceled or adjusted, the reservation is released. This prevents conflicts and ensures that confirmed orders can always be fulfilled from the available stock.
Reorder Alerts & Stock Replenishment: The agent monitors stock levels against predefined thresholds. If an item’s quantity falls below its threshold, it can trigger an alert to the FMCG Admin to replenish stock. In fully autonomous mode, the system could even generate an internal restock order automatically. Advanced implementations might use predictive analytics to forecast demand and automate stock replenishment before stock runs out
trilinkftz.com
. For example, if a certain snack is selling faster during festive seasons, the system might prompt earlier restocking.
Batch and Expiry Management (Optional): For perishable goods, the inventory agent can track batch numbers and expiry dates. This helps in first-expiry-first-out dispatch and alerts for any products nearing expiry, thus aiding in quality control. (This is a feature that can be expanded later if needed.)
Overall, the Inventory Management Agent serves as the backbone of the supply chain system – providing the data needed for order fulfillment and reporting. Keeping inventory data centralized ensures all users see consistent information and helps optimize stock levels to meet demand without overstocking
trilinkftz.com
.
Order Management Agent
The Order Management Agent handles the entire lifecycle of orders placed by local retail stores, from initiation to fulfillment. It is effectively the execution engine of the supply chain system, ensuring that every order is processed correctly and efficiently. In industry terms, an Order Management module “manages the order lifecycle, from creation to fulfillment and invoicing.”
medium.com
 Key responsibilities of this agent include:
Order Creation & Validation: When a retailer submits a new order, the Order agent records the order details (products, quantities, prices, retailer info, etc.) and timestamp. It then validates the order – for example, checking with the Inventory agent that enough stock is available for each item. If any item is out-of-stock or insufficient, the agent can flag the order for review (or mark those line items as backordered, depending on business rules).
Workflow Processing: Once validated, the order moves into processing. If the system is configured for automatic approvals, the Order agent will immediately confirm the order and proceed to fulfillment steps. If manual approval is required, the order will be marked as “Pending Admin Approval,” and the FMCG Admin is notified. Upon approval (manual or automatic), stock is reserved (via the Inventory agent) and the order is marked as confirmed. The agent then generates a pick/pack list for warehouse operations (if Arivu has a warehouse process for packing the goods).
Order Status Tracking: The Order agent updates the status of each order as it progresses: e.g., Confirmed, Packing, Shipped, Delivered, or Canceled. Both the admin and the retailer can see these status updates in real time. The agent can integrate with logistics information (if available internally or in the future via an external courier API) to update Shipped/Delivered status. (For now, without external integration, the admin may update status to “Shipped” when dispatching, and perhaps “Delivered” when confirmed delivered.)
Invoicing: A crucial part of order completion is invoicing. The Order Management Agent automatically generates an invoice once an order is confirmed/fulfilled, detailing the purchased items, quantities, prices, taxes, and total amount due. This invoice is linked to the order and stored in the system. Generating the invoice is an integral part of order processing, as noted in supply chain systems where order services handle order fulfillment and invoicing
medium.com
. The invoice is made accessible to both the admin and the retailer (for printing or payment processing offline).
Returns/Cancellations Handling: If a retailer cancels an order (or part of it) or returns products, the Order agent processes these events. It will adjust the order record, update inventory (returned items go back to stock if applicable), and if an invoice was generated, issue a credit note or update the billing records accordingly. This ensures that the system remains the source of truth for order histories and financial reconciliation.
Notifications: The Order agent works closely with a Notification service (if configured) to send out alerts. For example, when an order is confirmed or shipped, it can trigger an email/SMS to the retailer. This keeps the retailer informed without needing to constantly check the system. (Notifications are an auxiliary function listening to order events
medium.com
medium.com
, which can be added as needed.)
In summary, the Order Management Agent is the orchestrator that ensures every order is efficiently captured, processed, and completed. By automating steps like order validation and invoice creation, the system speeds up fulfillment while minimizing human error
trilinkftz.com
. At the same time, it provides the flexibility for the admin to intervene on critical decisions (like approvals or exception handling) when operating in semi-manual mode.
Customer Management Agent
The Customer Management Agent focuses on managing all the data related to the customers of the system – the local retail stores. (In a broader context, if Arivu Foods ever sells directly to end consumers, this module could also manage consumer data, but our current scope is B2B.) This agent functions akin to a CRM (Customer Relationship Management) component within the supply chain platform. According to supply chain design references, a customer management service maintains key information like customer name, contacts, addresses, and financial details
medium.com
. For our implementation, the agent’s features include:
Retailer Profile Database: Store and organize detailed profiles for each retail partner. This includes the store’s official name, branch (if multiple outlets), owner/manager contact info, shipping/delivery addresses, billing address, and any registration details (e.g., tax ID or account number). The profile may also contain custom fields such as the retailer’s region or category (useful for sales analysis).
Account Status and Terms: Track the business terms with each retailer. For instance, some retailers might have credit terms (allowed to pay X days after delivery), while others pay COD (cash on delivery). The agent can store each customer’s credit limit or payment terms, so that the Order agent can enforce them (e.g., not allowing new orders if a customer exceeds their credit limit or has overdue invoices).
Order History & Insights: Integrate with the Order Management Agent to record each customer’s order history. This allows the system to generate customer-specific insights – like total orders to date, frequency of orders, and favorite products. The Customer agent can feed this data to the Analytics dashboard, enabling the FMCG Admin to see, for example, the “Top 10 Retailers by Sales” or identify dormant customers (those who haven’t ordered in a long time).
Communication Log: Optionally, maintain a log of communications or notes with each customer. For example, if the admin had a discussion with a retailer about a special discount or a service issue, they can note it in the system for future reference. This is not explicitly required, but it enriches the CRM aspect if needed.
Access Control & Authentication: Since each retail store user will have a login, the Customer Management Agent works hand-in-hand with the authentication system to manage user accounts and permissions. It ensures a retailer user can only access their own data. (In a technical implementation, this might be part of an Authentication/Authorization service
medium.com
, but we mention it here as it relates to customer data security.) Role-based access control is implemented so that an FMCG Admin vs. a Retailer have different permissions, ensuring each user only sees data relevant to their account
trilinkftz.com
.
By consolidating all retailer information, the Customer Management Agent helps Arivu Foods maintain strong relationships with their clients. It provides a 360° view of each retail partner – combining static data (profiles) with dynamic data (order history, payments) – all within the same platform. This centralized customer info not only streamlines order processing (since addresses and preferences are on file) but also enables personalized service (the admin can tailor offerings or communication knowing the customer’s history).
Billing & Invoice Agent
The Billing & Invoice Agent handles all financial documentation and transactions related to orders. While the Order Management Agent triggers invoice creation, this Billing agent is dedicated to managing those invoices and ensuring proper financial records. Its inclusion guarantees that the system covers the order-to-cash cycle, not just order placement. In essence, this agent makes the platform function as an order management system (OMS) that covers invoicing and payment tracking as well as orders
oracle.com
. Key functions of the Billing & Invoice Agent include:
Invoice Generation: For every confirmed order, generate a formal invoice document (with a unique invoice number, date, bill-to and ship-to details, itemized list of products with quantities and prices, applicable taxes, and total amount due). The agent pulls necessary data from the order (via Order agent) and customer profile (via Customer agent) to compose the invoice. This process is automatic and instantaneous once an order is marked fulfilled, reflecting the OMS practice of automating invoicing as part of order processing
oracle.com
. The generated invoice is stored in the system database and is accessible to both the admin and the retailer through their dashboards.
Payment Status Tracking: Although our current scope does not include online payment integration, the Billing agent can still track whether an invoice has been paid. For example, the FMCG Admin can mark an invoice as paid once they receive a bank transfer or cash from the retailer. The agent updates the invoice status (Paid, Pending, Overdue) accordingly. This is useful for the admin to see accounts receivable at a glance, and for the retailer to see if their payments have been logged.
Billing Reports: Provide financial reports such as total sales over a period, pending payments, and payment history. This overlaps with the Analytics Agent’s reporting but specifically focuses on financial metrics. For instance, the admin can generate a report of all invoices for the month and their status, or the total revenue from a particular retailer in a quarter.
Credit Note / Adjustments: If an order is partially returned or there was an error in billing, the Billing agent can issue a credit note or adjust the original invoice. This ensures the financial records remain accurate. For example, if a retailer returns goods worth ₹500 from an ₹5000 invoice, a credit note of ₹500 can be created and linked to that invoice.
Integration-Ready Design: In the future, if online payment gateways or an accounting software need to be integrated, this agent would be the focal point for such integration. (For now, “no integration” is required, but the module is designed such that it could send invoice data to, say, a QuickBooks API or accept payment confirmations from a payment gateway in later phases.)
By automating invoicing and centralizing billing information, the system ensures transparency in transactions. The retailer always has access to their invoices, and the admin can easily track who owes what at any time. This reduces the manual effort of preparing invoices and tracking payments, which in traditional systems is often error-prone. In combination with the Order and Customer agents, the Billing agent closes the loop of the sales process – from order placement to payment.
Analytics & Dashboard Agent
The Analytics & Dashboard Agent is responsible for aggregating data from all other agents to provide meaningful insights and visualizations for users. Each user (Admin or Retailer) is presented with a dashboard tailored to their needs, powered by this agent’s analysis. Modern inventory and order systems emphasize real-time reporting to help predict demand and optimize operations
trilinkftz.com
, and our system follows this approach. The agent’s functions include:
Data Aggregation: Collect data streams and records from the Inventory, Order, Customer, and Billing agents. This includes current inventory levels, order statuses, sales figures, and customer information. The agent regularly updates its data models so that the dashboards reflect the latest information (potentially in real time or near-real-time). For example, when a new order is confirmed, the sales figures and inventory counts should update on the dashboard without delay.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Compute essential metrics for the business. For the FMCG Admin, typical KPIs might be: total orders this week/month, total revenue, top 5 selling products, current inventory value, order fulfillment rate (what percentage of orders are fulfilled on time), and maybe supply chain efficiency metrics (like average time to fulfill an order). For the Retailer, KPIs could include: total spend, number of orders placed, top products ordered, and maybe an estimate of profit if such data is available. The system’s reporting component subscribes to various events to update these metrics and dashboards continuously
medium.com
.
Visualizations & Reports: Present the above metrics in user-friendly formats – charts, graphs, and tables on the dashboard UI. Examples: a line chart of sales over time, a bar chart of top product sales, a pie chart of inventory composition by category, etc. Also, generate detailed reports that the user can drill down into or export (e.g., a report of all orders in a date range, or an inventory valuation report). Advanced reporting features might list Top Products, Top Customers, Top Categories, etc. to inform strategic decisions
oracle.com
. These reports help identify areas for improvement and guide marketing or stocking strategies.
Alerts and Insights: The Analytics agent can also highlight anomalies or important alerts. For example, it might flag “Product X is low in stock!” or “Retailer Y’s order frequency has dropped this month” or “Invoice Z is overdue by 10 days”. Such insights draw the user’s attention to areas that need action. This goes beyond static reporting, providing a layer of business intelligence.
User-Specific Customization: Ensure that each role’s dashboard only shows data relevant to them. The FMCG Admin sees system-wide data (all products, all orders, all customers), whereas a Retailer sees only their own order history and perhaps comparative benchmarks (like how this month’s orders compare to last month for their own store). This separation is crucial for data privacy and relevance. It is achieved through the system’s access control and by scoping queries per user role.
Through the Analytics & Dashboard Agent, the supply chain management system becomes not just a transactional system but also a decision-support system. By having on-demand analytics, Arivu Foods can predict trends (e.g., forecast product demand) and optimize stock levels accordingly
trilinkftz.com
, while retailers can make informed decisions about what and when to reorder. Ultimately, this data-driven approach helps both the supplier and customers run their businesses more effectively.
Autonomous vs. Manual Operations
One of the key design goals of this system is to support both fully autonomous operation and manual control, depending on the scenario and user preference. Each agent described above can operate in an automated way to minimize the need for human intervention, but the FMCG Admin can override or configure manual checkpoints as needed. Below are some examples of how autonomy vs. manual control are balanced in the system:
Inventory Autonomy: The Inventory agent can automatically update stock levels and even trigger reorders or alerts when stock is low. In a fully autonomous mode, the system might, for instance, auto-generate a restock order (or a notification to the supplier/manufacturing unit) when a product’s quantity falls below its threshold. This is in line with best practices where automated stock replenishment helps streamline operations
trilinkftz.com
trilinkftz.com
. In manual mode, the system would simply alert the admin, and the admin decides if/when to reorder. The admin can also manually adjust inventory if an automated count seems off (e.g., after an audit).
Order Processing Autonomy: In a hands-off configuration, incoming orders from retailers could be auto-approved and processed immediately if stock is available, and the picking/shipping queue is updated for warehouse staff. This automated order processing greatly speeds up fulfillment
trilinkftz.com
. However, the system allows for manual oversight – the admin can require that each order is reviewed and approved before confirmation. This might be desired if, for example, certain large orders need credit checks or if the admin wants to verify pricing for special cases. The admin dashboard would list pending orders for approval in that case.
Automated Invoicing & Payment: The creation of invoices is always automatic (to ensure no orders are missed). However, payment processing is semi-manual in the current scope. The system can send out an invoice automatically to the retailer’s email upon order confirmation (autonomous), but the admin might manually follow up on payment or adjust terms for a particular retailer. If online payments were integrated in the future, payments could be auto-reconciled to invoices.
Customer Onboarding: Adding a new retailer into the system could be done by the admin manually (to verify legitimacy of the business). Alternatively, the system could provide a sign-up portal for retailers (autonomous onboarding), which the admin then approves. Currently, we assume manual addition to ensure B2B partnership vetting.
Alerts and Exceptions: In autonomous mode, the system will handle routine tasks and only escalate to the admin when something unusual occurs (e.g., an order fails to process, inventory count mismatch, etc.). In manual mode, the admin might receive more frequent notifications for review. For example, if an order triggers a low-stock situation, in autonomous mode the system might directly create a restock request, whereas in manual mode it would simply alert the admin to make a decision.
Balancing autonomy with manual control ensures the system is both efficient and flexible. Early on, Arivu Foods might prefer more manual control to build trust in the system’s accuracy. As confidence grows, more autonomous features can be turned on, allowing the software agents to handle repetitive tasks in the background. This design mirrors the concept of “variable autonomy”, where control can shift between the system and human operators as needed
frontiersin.org
. The ultimate goal is to reduce mundane workloads (through automation) while still keeping humans in the loop for critical decisions.
Technology Stack & Architecture
The Supply Chain Management system is built with a modern, scalable architecture using Python and FastAPI. FastAPI serves as the backend framework, enabling us to develop each agent as a RESTful service (or as logical modules within a larger API). Here we outline the key technical aspects and how the agents come together:
Modular (Microservice-Inspired) Design: Each agent (Inventory, Order, Customer, Billing, Analytics) can be developed as an independent module or service. In a microservices architecture, these would be separate FastAPI applications/services, each with its own database or schema, communicating via API calls or an event bus. For example, an Order service might call an Inventory service’s API to reserve stock, or better, emit an event that the Inventory service listens to
medium.com
. This decoupling follows the principle of single-responsibility and improves scalability – each component can be scaled or modified without affecting others
medium.com
. For the initial implementation, these could also reside in a single FastAPI project as separate routers or modules (a modular monolith), which can later be split out if needed.
Central Database: The system will use a database (e.g., PostgreSQL or MySQL) to store data for all the above modules. Tables might include Products, Inventory, Orders, OrderItems, Customers, Invoices, etc. A well-structured relational database allows maintaining integrity between these entities (e.g., orders linked to customers and order items linked to products). This equates to a centralized data architecture, ensuring real-time inventory visibility and simplified reporting from one source of truth
trilinkftz.com
. In the future, if needed, the architecture could evolve (e.g., separate databases per service or using NoSQL for certain high-scale components), but a single DB is simpler for now given the moderate scale (Arivu and its retailers).
API Endpoints: FastAPI will expose endpoints for all functionalities. Some examples: POST /orders (place a new order), GET /orders/{id} (order status), GET /inventory/{product_id} (check stock), POST /customers (add new retailer), GET /reports/sales (fetch analytics data). These APIs can be consumed by a web frontend or even a mobile app in the future. FastAPI’s high performance and intuitive syntax make it suitable for this purpose, and it supports asynchronous operation which is useful for I/O-bound tasks like sending emails or calling external services.
User Interface: While this document focuses on the backend (agents), it’s envisioned that there will be a web-based UI (and possibly a mobile app later) for users to interact with. The FMCG Admin might have an admin web portal, and Retailers have a login to a portal where they can place orders and view dashboards. The UI will communicate with the backend via the FastAPI endpoints (possibly through an API Gateway or a Backend-for-Frontend layer). This separation ensures that the system is flexible – the same API could even allow integration with other systems, if needed, in the future
trilinkftz.com
.
Event-Driven Communication: In more advanced deployments, we can implement an event bus (using technologies like RabbitMQ, Kafka, or even simple Redis/pub-sub) to handle cross-agent communication asynchronously. For example, when an order is placed, instead of a direct API call, the Order agent could emit an order.created event; the Inventory agent, upon hearing that event, would reserve stock and emit an inventory.reserved event; the Billing agent could listen for an order.completed event to generate an invoice, and so on
medium.com
medium.com
. This event-driven approach decouples services and is resilient and scalable. However, it adds complexity, so initially a simpler direct-call approach might be used with clear module boundaries.
Security & Permissions: The system uses a robust authentication mechanism (e.g., JWT tokens or OAuth2 with password flow in FastAPI) to ensure only authorized users access the endpoints. As mentioned earlier, role-based access control (RBAC) is enforced: an admin token allows full access, a retailer token only allows access to that retailer’s own data for certain endpoints. All data transactions can be logged for audit purposes. Additionally, sensitive operations (like updating inventory or deleting records) could have safeguards such as confirmation prompts or restricted access.
Reliability & Scalability: Python and FastAPI provide a good foundation; the services can be containerized with Docker and deployed to cloud infrastructure. We could use load balancing to handle concurrent users (though initially the user base – Arivu plus retailers – is manageable). The database should be regularly backed up. If needed, we can incorporate caching (e.g., using Redis) for frequently accessed data (like product catalog or inventory levels) to improve read performance. The modular nature also means we can scale specific agents if one becomes a bottleneck (e.g., if analytics queries are heavy, that part can be offloaded to a reporting database or scaled out).
In summary, the technology stack is chosen to be flexible, modern, and integration-ready. While the current scope is self-contained (no external integrations such as payment gateways or supplier systems yet), the use of a REST API architecture means we can integrate with other systems later with minimal disruption
trilinkftz.com
. For instance, connecting to an e-commerce storefront or a third-party logistics API would be straightforward via additional FastAPI endpoints or event handlers. The design ensures that Arivu Foods’ supply chain operations are not only automated and efficient today, but also prepared for expansion and integration tomorrow.
Conclusion:
By implementing the above agents and architecture, Arivu Foods will have a centralized, intelligent supply chain management system tailored to its product line and B2B relationships. All core functions – from keeping optimal inventory levels to processing retailer orders and analyzing sales trends – are handled within one platform. The FMCG Admin gains fine-grained control and visibility over the entire supply chain, while local retail store partners benefit from a seamless ordering experience and transparency. Moreover, the combination of automation with manual overrides provides the best of both worlds: routine tasks are streamlined (reducing workload and errors), and strategic decisions remain under human control. This system, built with Python and FastAPI, not only addresses Arivu’s current needs (inventory, orders, customers, analytics, billing) but is robust and modular enough to grow with the business – whether that means scaling up the user base, adding new features, or integrating with external services in the future. In essence, the supply chain management agents work in concert to ensure that the right products are at the right place at the right time, all while keeping all stakeholders informed and the business operations efficient

trilinkftz.com
. With this foundation in place, Arivu Foods can focus on expanding its market and product offerings, confident that the supply chain system will support and drive that growth.
